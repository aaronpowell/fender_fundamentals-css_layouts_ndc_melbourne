Hannes is a developer, a coach and a father of 3.

In his role as a .NET consultant at Axxes, he likes performance, databases, distributed systems and large scale apps. But most of all, he likes playing devil’s advocate in technical discussions by playing the ‘it depends’ card.

In his free time, when he’s not building LEGO® castles with his kids, he likes to spend time building guitars, playing chess & poker, tasting whisky and doing all round geeky stuff.

You can occasionally find him on an afterparty stage at PubConf or with Dylan Beattie & the Linebreakers.
