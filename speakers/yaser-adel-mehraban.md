Although it doesn’t look like it, Yaser is an almond croissant addict cleverly disguised as a successful web developer. Since it was relatively clear early on that it would be slightly more than difficult to make a living out of thin air and sitting in a café eating a croissant and drinking a cappuccino, he’s focused his energy on the web, which happily has proven itself to be a wonderful decision.

Apart from that, he has a hunger for public speaking, hence a number of talks in big conferences like NDC and Voxxed Days around the world under his belt.
