I am 24 years old software engineer obsessed with front-end development. Simultaneously I am teaching 12-16 years old teenagers about Web Technologies. 2 years ago I was on the Dark side - developing with COBOL programming language on Mainframe supercomputers! Due to slow evolvement and limitations of used technologies, I decided to shift them pretty drastically.

In general, I think we would not need to stick to any specific technology in this rapidly evolving IT World but try and use various different ones instead. Every new experience increases our creativity, knowledge, curiosity and expands mindset. My latest discovery which I found to be super fun & beneficial field is music programming. I want to share about this one!
