Any exiting business you meet and talk to will be using software! Over time businesses settle on a mixture of both generalized and specialized solutions to fulfill their various requirements - and now we need to connect these systems.

It's common to see direct point-to-point integrations being developed where these systems can become tightly coupled and harder to update or migrate away from.

In this workshop we will explore how to use elastic-scale Azure resources such as Azure Service Bus, Function Apps and Cosmos DB to build resilient, decoupled integrations.

We will be looking at:

2. Serverless Integrations at the edge
3. Centralized Management and Monitoring
4. Event Sourcing
5. Cost
