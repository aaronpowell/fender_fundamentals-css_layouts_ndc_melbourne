GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.

That sounds nice, but what is GraphQL and how can we use it in .NET?


This workshop will give you the basics for understanding GraphQL and then dive deep into advanced concepts like subscriptions. We will do this by building together a little slack clone and exploring how we can solve the problems of such a service by leveraging GraphQL.

You will learn how to build a GraphQL server in .NET as well as how we can consume GraphQL in Blazor WebAssembly applications.

After this workshop you will know what GraphQL is. You will know how to build GraphQL servers in .NET and various concepts of building a GraphQL schema.

Let’s get the basics right.


We will explore what GraphQL is and what it is not and how it compares to other service API technologies like REST and gRPC.


What is the query language and how can we apply it?


Overview over the GraphQL schema definition language and exploration of the GraphQL type system.


We will look at design principles for GraphQL schemas.

Putting GraphQL to use.


Let’s start applying our GraphQL knowledge! We will take GraphQL for a ride and build
with it step by step a small slack clone that uses a wide range of GraphQL features like subscriptions, filters, persisted queries and many more things.


We will try out several GraphQL tools and see what we can do with them and our slack endpoint.


We will pick up Blazor and build with it a simple real-time UI that uses our slack endpoint.
