JavaScript is the language that enables all of the dynamic aspects of the web, such as real time updates, notifications, as well as more advanced features in the browser. TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, enables great tooling and better structuring of large JavaScript applications.

In this session, we will cover the next big thing in modern web development: Typescript, which brings types, decorators and many more features on top of what JavaScript already does.
