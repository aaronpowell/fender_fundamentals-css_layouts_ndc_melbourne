Where is the border between frontend and backend web development? Yeah, exactly. It is becoming increasingly common for developers to work in both areas, yet only have the skillset for one. This often results in relying on third party frameworks or components like Bootstrap to pull a layout together, further weighing down the application with unnecessary code libraries and resulting technical debt.

This hands-on workshop covers modern front end fundamentals, enabling you to create a layout and components without the need for any third party code. Touching on the various layout specs, including Flexbox, CSS Grid and when to use floats and tables (yes there is a time and place for these).
