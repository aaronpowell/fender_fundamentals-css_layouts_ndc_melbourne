The explosive growth of web frameworks and the demands of users have changed the approach to building enterprise applications. Many challenges exist and just getting started can be a daunting prospect. Let's change that now.

This hands-on workshop provides practical guidance and recommendations. We will cover architecture, technologies, tools and frameworks. We will examine strategies for organizing your projects, folders and files. We will design a system that is simple to build and maintain - now and well into the future.


You will leave this workshop having developed the foundation and structure for your next enterprise application, along with the knowledge to take your enterprise application development to the next level.
